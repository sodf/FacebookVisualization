			<h1>Motivation</h1>
			<p>
			Our motivation is to assess social activities on Facebook to gain more insight into people’s relationships. Facebook users who are interested to know how they interact with their friends can use our visualization. We created a summary visualization showing likes and comments that occured between two people along with a picture that the two people are tagged in. While Facebook is a popular Social Network Site to manage relationships, online social networks fall short in mimicking traditional social behavior that people illustrate when trying to deepen a friendship. We hope our visualization can give a chance for users to evaluate whether their interactions on Facebook reflect as a metaphor for their friendship in the physical world.
